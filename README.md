## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js and npm:** Download and install from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
- **MongoDB:** Install and run MongoDB. You can find instructions and downloads at [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
  - The application connects to `mongodb://localhost:27017` and uses the `restaurantDB` database by default. This can be configured in `backend/server.js`.

## Setup and Running the Application

Follow these steps to get the application up and running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd RestaurantApp
    ```
    (Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.)

2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the necessary Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    From the `backend` directory, start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    For development with auto-restarts on file changes, use `nodemon`:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server will typically run on `http://localhost:3000`. You should see confirmation messages in your console upon successful startup and MongoDB connection.

4.  **Access the Frontend:**
    Open your web browser and go to:
    [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

    The `index.html` file will be served, providing the user interface for the system.

## Further Development

This project serves as a robust starting point. Here are some areas for future enhancements:

-   **Enhanced Frontend UI/UX:** Improve the overall user interface and experience for menu, order, and analytics sections.
-   **Full Order Management:** Implement comprehensive CRUD operations for orders on the frontend, including detailed order views and real-time status updates (e.g., using WebSockets).
-   **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Develop a more interactive and complete search and filtering UI for menu items.
-   **Interactive Analytics Dashboard:** Create a dynamic frontend dashboard to visualize sales data and other analytics using charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js).
-   **Authentication & Authorization:** Implement a secure login system for administrators and staff with role-based access control.
-   **Robust Data Validation:** Enhance data validation on both the frontend and backend to ensure data integrity.
-   **Improved Error Handling:** Provide more user-friendly error messages and robust error logging.
-   **Soft Deletes/Archival:** Fully implement soft deletion for menu items and orders to maintain historical data for analytics.
-   **Order Customization:** Ensure comprehensive handling of order customizations and special notes.
