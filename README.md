# Restaurant Menu & Order Management System

This project is a Restaurant Menu & Order Management System built with a Node.js backend, MongoDB database, and a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend.

## Prerequisites

*   **Node.js and npm:** Make sure you have Node.js (which includes npm) installed. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **MongoDB:** Ensure MongoDB is installed and running on your system. You can download it from [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
    *   The application will attempt to connect to `mongodb://localhost:27017` and use a database named `restaurantDB` by default. You can change this in `backend/server.js` if needed.

## Setup and Running the Application

1.  **Clone/Download the Project:**
    If you haven't already, get the project files onto your local machine.

2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the `backend` directory in your terminal and install the required Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the backend server from the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will typically start the server on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by `process.env.PORT`). You should see a message in the console like `Backend server running at http://localhost:3000` and `Connected to MongoDB: restaurantDB`.

    For development, you can use `nodemon` if you installed it as a dev dependency (it's included in `package.json`):
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will automatically restart the server when you make changes to the backend files.

4.  **Access the Frontend:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to:
    [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

    The `index.html` file from the `frontend` directory will be served.

## Core Features Implemented (Basic)

*   **Menu Management (Frontend & Backend):**
    *   Add new menu items (Name, Category, Price, Ingredients, Tags, Availability).
    *   View menu items.
    *   Delete menu items.
    *   Edit menu items (placeholder UI, backend logic implemented).
    *   Search/filter menu items (backend supports various filters like name, category, tags, price range; frontend UI for this is basic).
*   **Order Management (Backend - Basic):**
    *   API endpoint to create new orders (`POST /api/orders`).
    *   API endpoint to get orders (`GET /api/orders`).
    *   API endpoint to update order status (`PUT /api/orders/:id/status`).
    *   Frontend UI for order management is minimal in `index.html` and needs further development.
*   **Analytics (Backend - Basic Examples):**
    *   API endpoint for a sample sales report (`GET /api/analytics/sales-report`).
    *   API endpoint for most ordered dishes (`GET /api/analytics/most-ordered-dishes`).
    *   Frontend integration for displaying analytics (e.g., using Chart.js) is not yet implemented.

## Further Development & Optional Modules

Based on the project description, the following areas can be further developed:

*   **Enhanced Frontend UI/UX:** Improve the user interface for menu and order management, and for displaying analytics.
*   **Order Management:**
    *   Full CRUD operations for orders on the frontend.
    *   Detailed order view.
    *   Real-time order status tracking (e.g., using WebSockets or polling).
*   **Search & Filtering:** Implement comprehensive search and filtering UI on the frontend for menu items.
*   **Analytics Dashboard:** Create a frontend dashboard to visualize the analytics data (e.g., using Chart.js, D3.js).
*   **Authentication Module:** Implement admin and staff login with role-based access control (JWT or session-based).
*   **Data Validation:** Add more robust data validation on both frontend and backend.
*   **Error Handling:** Improve error handling and user feedback.
*   **Soft Deletes/Archival:** Fully implement soft deletes for menu items and orders if required for analytics.
*   **Customization & Notes:** Ensure order customization and notes are fully handled.

## Technology Stack Used

*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
*   **Database:** MongoDB
*   **Other Libraries:**
    *   `cors` (for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
    *   `nodemon` (for development, auto-restarts server)

This provides a starting point for the Restaurant Menu & Order Management System. You can now expand upon this foundation to implement all the features outlined in the project description.
